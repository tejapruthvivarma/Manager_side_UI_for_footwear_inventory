How I handeled back button after logging out.
1) I used a single page application approach
2) I fetch the html code from html_load.txt via load.chi perl script.
3) I just print this response to a div tag which was preiviously empty and hidden
4) All load.cgi is called via login.cgi script after successful logging in
5) Once I press logout, I am calling logoout.cgi script
6) In logout.cgi script I am deleting sessions and coockie
7) After successful logging out I delete previously printed response and reload the landing page manually,
8) Thus, when after logging out if user presses back button it loads him  to page open prior to opening this login page.
9)
I used this approach because,
it is cross browser campatiable, fast, secure.
